# Subway Times
Real-time train arrival tracker. Save frequently visited stops for easy access.

## Motivation
I wanted to build an web application that I would also use. I always use the [citymapper](https://citymapper.com/?lang=en) app to check when the train is comming. Why not make my own?

This project also uses a custom [API](https://github.com/loripb/subway-times-api)
